# WavePart

Set of Matlab(r) functions for the partition of directional wave spectra to its wind and different swell components. The partitions are initially identified using a watershed defining algorithm  and then are modified following mostly the method described in Hanson and Phillips (2001).

V1.1 October 2019. Corrected the following  errors: (i) in estimation mean period in waveparams.m; (ii) a coding bug in function   valley_min.m; (iii) added diagnostic parameter and number of partitions in waveparams.m
